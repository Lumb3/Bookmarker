# 🎥 YouTube Bookmark Extension

A lightweight Chrome extension that lets you **bookmark, rename, delete, and replay** key moments in YouTube videos — perfect for learners, content creators, and anyone who wants to revisit important timestamps with ease. 

This project demonstrates key concepts in **DOM manipulation**, **Chrome Extension APIs**, and **Chrome Storage**. To build this extension, industry level version control, Git, is used for tracking the source code and debugging.
